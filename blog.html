                Differences between 'local storage' and 'session storage':

                            The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB
                        </li>
                        <li>

                        <li>
                            As local storage is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Session storage is session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored
                            only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed

                            The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global
                            variables and have global scope.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Block scope is a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                            variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
                            conditional statements, or something else.

                        <li>
                            Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
                            function or conditional state can access that variable
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            in block scope it is only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets
                            {}.

                When we get undefined in javascript ?
            </h2>
            <h3>
                undefined is a primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have just been declared, or to
                formal arguments for which there are no actual arguments.
            </h3>
            <ul>

                <li>
                    A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have
                    an assigned value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A function returns undefined if a value was not returned .

                How event loop works ? ?
            </h2>
            <h3>
                JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code,
                collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Event Loop is an advanced-level JavaScript concept, the Event loop is a function of javascript that
                places the instructions waiting in the event queue to the global execution stack. When you are working
                with asynchronous execution you have 3 different environments running which are namely: Execution stack,
                WEB APIs, and event/message queue.
