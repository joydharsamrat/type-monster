                Differences between 'local storage' and 'session storage':

                            The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB

                        <li>
                            As local storage is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Session storage is session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored
                            only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed

                Differences between 'global scope' and 'block scope':
            </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global
                            variables and have global scope.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Block scope is a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                            variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
                            conditional statements, or something else.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
                            function or conditional state can access that variable
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            in block scope it is only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets
                            {}.
